Just train a new wakeword

## About
In order to train a new wakeword you have to have read very far in mycroft. in the endefekt but deas wakeword is only a few times spoken and bad detection sorted out. you could not do that through speech. i have thought about it but have too little idea to do it myself.

## Examples
* "I want to call you christopher"
